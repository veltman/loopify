# loopify

Some basic seamless looping with the WebAudioAPI.  Works in [some browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api), not IE so much.

There's a [very brief demo](http://veltman.github.io/loopify/demo.html).

## Why?

Because looping an HTML5 audio element is generally inconsistent and not seamless.  You'll often get a little gap at the beginning of every new play with something like this:

```html
<audio loop>
  <source src="whoompthereitis.mp3" type"audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<!-- Whoomp there it isn't :( -->
```

## How?

Include `loopify.js` on a page and create a loop with `loopify(url,callback)`.

```html
<script src="loopify.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script>

// SUpply an audio filename and a callback
loopify("whoompthereitis.mp3",function(err,loop) {

  // If something went wrong, `err` is supplied
  if (err) {
    return console.err(err);
  }

  // Play it whenever you want
  loop.play();

  // Stop it later if you feel like it
  loop.stop();

});

</script>
```

## More details, barely

### loopify(url,callback)

`url` is an audio filename or full URL. It has to be reachable by XHR.

`callback` is a function that takes two arguments, `err` and `loop`:

```js

function ready(err,loop) {
  // do something with err

  // or do something with loop
}

```

`err` will be `null` as long as the audio was successfully loaded.

The `loop` parameter has two methods: `.stop()` and `.play()`.  You can trigger those however you want, as many times as you want.

If you call `loop.play()` on a loop that's already playing, it will reset to the beginning of the loop.

## Notes

You should probably use `.wav` files for short loops, because compressed formats like `.mp3` produce [different results in different browsers]([https://forestmist.org/blog/web-audio-api-loops-and-formats](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616190447/https://forestmist.org/blog/web-audio-api-loops-and-formats)).
